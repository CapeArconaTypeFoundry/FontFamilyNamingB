CA Font Family Naming[B]
========================

A FontLab Studio 5 Script


This script changes the font names of all opened fonts for the use as font families.
The naming method will also split up the family into single-font-families in the font menu in non-OT-savvy Windows applications.
This script changes the family and font names according to Karsten Lueckes “Font Naming, Scheme [B], Page 7/8, Version 1.02″ AS ONE DIFFERENCE: the script will style-link italic styles!
